Introduction to IPython
=======================

The files listed above were prepared and presented by Paul Ivanov as "slides"
in the order that they appear (except for this README.md file).

You can [watch the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPM--1R1tTU) of this
talk, or find the accompanying resources as well as all of the other talks
which were given at the [UC Berkeley Python
bootcamp](http://www.pythonbootcamp.info/agenda) in August 2012.
